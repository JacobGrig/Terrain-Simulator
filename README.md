# Terrain-Simulator
This is a game a wrote in 2017 as a part of a computer workshop. The task was completely on the free topic, the only requirements were to use some features of C++ and OOP, e.g. patterns, exceptions (including my own), multiple inheritance, encapsulation, etc.

Before using it you firstly should compile the program. After that all the instructions will be provided through the command line interface.

There are three regimes in this game:
1. City (with limited money);
2. City (with unlimited money);
3. Desert (God mode).

The first two regimes are obvious, the last one is a desert simulation, where some people want to build a city. Your power is restricted to using cataclysms to destroy buildings of people. Actually, this regime is infinite (as well as the second one) unless you want it to stop.
